# Statement Editor

The Statement Editor allows you to construct Ballerina statements depending on the use case you want to build. It is an intuitive visual editor that is easy to use without an in-depth knowledge of the [Ballerina Programming Language](https://ballerina.io/).

It provides the following:

- Context-based suggestions

- Ballerina libraries (standard libraries and language libraries)

- Pre-defined expression templates

- Documentation for functions and methods to configure parameters easily 

## Construct statements

This guide walks you through the steps to build the following statement using the editing capabilities of the Statement Editor. Later, you will explore different use cases.

```
final string userIdMsg = "UserID : " + id.toString();
```

Let's add the above statement to the main method of the given sample code below.

```
int id = 1234;
 
public function main() returns error? {
   // Statement will be added here
}
```

Follow the steps below to build the statement.

1. On the low-code diagram, click **+** within the main method. Then, click **Variable** in the **Add Constructs** pane that opens.

    ![Add variable statement](../img/statement-editor/add-variable-statement.gif)

    The Statement Editor opens displaying the syntax of a variable statement with the **`<add-expression>`** selected by default.v

2.  Click the **var** type descriptor on the statement and click **string** on the **Suggestions** tab.

    >**Info:** The **Suggestions** tab provides contextual suggestions based on the selected item. The **Suggestions** tab currently lists type suggestions because you selected the type descriptor.    

    ![Change type descriptor](../img/statement-editor/change-type-descriptor.gif)

    Here, you are specifying that the variable value is a string.

3. To edit the variable name, double-click **`variable`** and type `userIdMsg` in the text box.

    >**Info:** Another way to make a part of a statement editable is to click on the required statement component and press  **Enter**/**Return**.

    ![Edit variable name](../img/statement-editor/edit-variable-name.gif)

    If you want to make changes to the content you have added to the statement, you can undo and redo your actions via the relevant icons on the top left of the toolbar. You can also remove content via the icon for deleting.

4. Double click **`<add-expression>`** and type `"UserID : "` in the text box.

    >**Info:** To navigate from one item on the statement to another, you can also press **Tab** or **Shift** + **Tab**.

    ![Edit variable expression](../img/statement-editor/edit-variable-expression.gif)

    Here, you are entering static text as a part of the variable value.

5.  Follow the two approaches below to concatenate another expression to the String that you added right now.
    1. Click the **Plus (+)** operator in the toolbar
    2. Click the **Expressions** tab, and under the **Arithmetic** section, click the **Es + Ex** expression.

    Both of these methods will append another expression template to the existing expression. 

    >**Info:** The **Expressions** tab lists all the pre-defined templates that you can use to define complex expressions.

    ![Select expression template](../img/statement-editor/select-expression-template.gif)

    In the `Es + Ex` expression template, `Es` refers to the existing expression you clicked and selected. `+ Ex` combines another expression with `Es`.

6. Click the **Suggestions** tab and click on the **id** suggestion.

    ![Select id suggestions](../img/statement-editor/select-id-from-suggestions.gif)

     You view see some diagnostics generated for the suggestion you selected. Move on to the next step to resolve them. 

7. Follow the two approaches below to solve the diagnostics.

    1. Select the**code-actions** provided by the Statement Editor provides based on your preference. To view the options, click on the bulb icon next to the diagnostic.
    2. Click the **Suggestions** tab and click **toString()** in the suggestions list to convert the value to a string format.
    
    The **Suggestions** tab will also provide other supported functions that can be called for the given expression.

    >**Info:** When you select a function or a method call, the **Parameters** tab opens by default. This tab displays information about the selected function or method call including details about parameters, descriptions, and return type descriptions. On this tab, you can easily add parameters to the expression by selecting the checkboxes of the relevant parameters.

     ![Convert to String](../img/statement-editor/convert-to-string.gif)

     >**Note:** The Statement Editor clears all the diagnostics messages indicating that the statement is valid.

     Now, follow the steps below to make the variable a final. 

8. Click on the globe icon in the toolbar and select the **final** keyword. 

    >**Info:** The dropdown shows the possible modifiers for the statement that is currently being edited.

     ![Make final](../img/statement-editor/add-stmt-qualifier.gif)

     You view the variable statement as follows.

     ```
     final string userIdMsg = "UserID : " + id.toString();
     ```
    
    Now, you constructed a valid statement via the Statement Editor.

9. Click **Save** to add the variable statement to the low-code diagram.
