# Open Ballerina packages

You can work on a single [Ballerina package](https://ballerina.io/learn/package-references/) at a time or use [multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces) of the VS Code editor to work on several related Ballerina packages at the same time. 

## Open a Ballerina package

Use one of the following options to open a Ballerina package on the VS Code editor:

- From the command line, execute `code <path-to-package-dir>`.
- From the VS Code editor, click **File > Open Folder ...**.

## Open multiple Ballerina packages

Once you have one Ballerina package opened in the VS Code editor, you can add other related packages to the same workspace.

See the instructions on [adding folders to multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_adding-folders) in the VS Code editor for more details.
