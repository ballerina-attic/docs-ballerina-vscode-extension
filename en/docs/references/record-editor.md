# Record Editor

Record is the type system introduced by the Ballerina language to hold data by a user. You can use records when you want to define data schemas. Once the records are created, you can easily manipulate data inside a program.

Ballerina is a multi-paradigm language. You can define records in an imperative manner with Ballerina. On top of that, the Ballerina VS Code plugin comes with record editing capabilities, which will help you to edit records graphically.

In the record editor, you have the ability to create a record from scratch or create a record by importing a JSON.
